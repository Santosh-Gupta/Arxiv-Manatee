After the end of challenges, lung function, airway inflammation, features of airway remodelling, local T-cell cytokines and systemic ovalbumin-specific antibodies were monitored. Long term challenges resulted in airway hyperresponsiveness lasting 2 weeks and reduced baseline lung function for 6 weeks after their cessation. In contrast, these changes resolved within one week after short term challenges. Prolonged transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)1 production and marked peribronchial fibrosis were only induced by long term challenges. Importantly, fibrosis became apparent only after the onset of lung function changes and outlasted them. Further, long term challenges led to prolonged and intense airway inflammation with marked lymphocytosis, but moderate eosinophilia, sustained IL-5 production and ovalbumin-specific IgG2a antibodies, the latter suggesting a Th1 component to the immune response. In contrast, following short term challenges airway inflammation was dominated by eosinophils and associated with a strong, but transient IL-13 response.</td>\n",

We developed the first NF-tailored mind-body program (the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF) and adapted it for delivery via live videoconferencing to decrease participation barriers and increase its reach. In a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found that the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF had excellent feasibility and acceptability when delivered via live videoconferencing; furthermore, the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF showed proof of concept in improving QoL compared with an NF-tailored health education control program (the Health Enhancement Program for NF). A fully powered trial is needed to ascertain the efficacy and durability of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF delivered via secure live videoconferencing among geographically diverse patients.

However, this evidence is limited to medicine and investigating a selected set of components. No such studies have been conducted in other health areas such as Physical Therapy (PT) and allied health professions. Evidence specific to the PT area is needed to understand and quantify the association between design features and TE estimates to inform practice and decision-making in this field.

Findings: The findings help to define the context and vision in which the Intervisions cliniques program was set up and implemented, to identify the perceived benefits and disappointments with regard to the program. Set up in the Canadian public managed care system and university-affiliated hospital, the Intervisions cliniques program helps to create lines of communication and privileged exchanges between general practitioners and psychiatrists as well as to foster mutual knowledge and a crosscutting and interactive view within a shared clinical territory. Several benefits noted by the participants and the organizing committee demonstrate the importance and multimodal effects of this type of initiative. The case-discussion format used as a CME method meets the training needs of general practitioners and is widely appreciated. However, the pressing needs expressed by the general practitioners with regard to improving shared mental health care still pose many challenges.</td>\n",

Maintaining and disseminating the Intervisions Cliniques program will require provincial-wide system implementation strategies to train psychiatrist, support them and regional managers to monitor the quality of this innovative practice within a public managed care system. Clinical implications • In the context of Continuing Medical Education (CME), case discussions are valued because they help to address the full complexity of clinical situations. • In the development of shared mental health care, direct contacts between general practitioners and psychiatrists are an optimal way to foster mutual knowledge and a crosscutting and interactive view within a shared clinical territory. • The Intervisions cliniques program contributes to shared mental health care and is a CME strategy that should be reproduced.

J Fam Med Dis Prev 2017, 3:055 the most effective strategy leading to a change in practice [9]. “Problem-based learning” begins by exposure to a clinical problem with learning taking place through a process of understanding and solving this problem [10,11]. Although the effect observed in terms of knowledge acquisition and changes in practice is only moderately greater for “problem-based learning” compared to traditional methods, this method has been most favoured by the majority of physicians and gives rise to greater motivation and satisfaction [12-17]. A review of the literature on the organization of CME activities based on case discussions and “problem-based learning” has helped to identify the few publications on the subject and the need to further document best practices in CME and the organizational issues involved in implementing this type of activity for general practitioners and psychiatrists [18]. The opportunity came up in Montreal with a CME initiative involving psychiatrists and general practitioners using case discussion to foster acquisition of mental health knowledge: the Intervisions cliniques program. More specifically, this article aims to: • Describe the Intervisions cliniques program as implemented in a university psychiatric hospital with a catchment-area responsibility for the east-end of Montreal (circa 500,000 inhabitants); • Identify the medical education vision and needs met by this approach; and • Explore the challenges involved in implementing the Intervisions cliniques program and the conditions that would be conducive to maintaining and generalizing the program.</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) are a group of drugs that with long-term use induce a pseudomenopausal state in which estrogen production is suppressed. They are commonly used in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent conditions. \"Add-back\" hormone replacement therapy is used to prevent menopause-like symptoms and bone loss during GnRHa treatment, but it is also recognized that hypoestrogenism adversely affects vascular function. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of GnRHa and add-back therapy on vascular reactivity. This model serves as a paradigm for the effect of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

One group received estrogen/progestogen add-back therapy during the second 3 months of GnRHa treatment. Vascular reactivity was examined by use of ultrasound measurements of changes in brachial artery diameter. Endothelium-dependent changes were assessed during reactive hyperemia, whereas endothelium-independent changes were measured after the administration of glyceryl trinitrate sublingual spray. Treatment with the GnRHa alone had an inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation. However, endothelium-dependent relaxation significantly improved in the group receiving add-back therapy (14.6%) compared with the group treated with GnRHa alone (8.6%) (P&lt;0.01). There were no significant endothelium-independent changes in either group.\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

Data mainly come from the program-related literature, direct observation and interviews with 9 key actors, assembled in 2 groups of promoters and participants of the program. Findings: The findings help to define the context and vision in which the Intervisions cliniques program was set up and implemented, to identify the perceived benefits and disappointments with regard to the program. Set up in the Canadian public managed care system and university-affiliated hospital, the Intervisions cliniques program helps to create lines of communication and privileged exchanges between general practitioners and psychiatrists as well as to foster mutual knowledge and a crosscutting and interactive view within a shared clinical territory. Several benefits noted by the participants and the organizing committee demonstrate the importance and multimodal effects of this type of initiative. The case-discussion format used as a CME method meets the training needs of general practitioners and is widely appreciated. However, the pressing needs expressed by the general practitioners with regard to improving shared mental health care still pose many challenges.</td>\n",

Maintaining and disseminating the Intervisions Cliniques program will require provincial-wide system implementation strategies to train psychiatrist, support them and regional managers to monitor the quality of this innovative practice within a public managed care system. Clinical implications • In the context of Continuing Medical Education (CME), case discussions are valued because they help to address the full complexity of clinical situations. • In the development of shared mental health care, direct contacts between general practitioners and psychiatrists are an optimal way to foster mutual knowledge and a crosscutting and interactive view within a shared clinical territory. • The Intervisions cliniques program contributes to shared mental health care and is a CME strategy that should be reproduced.

J Fam Med Dis Prev 2017, 3:055 the most effective strategy leading to a change in practice [9]. “Problem-based learning” begins by exposure to a clinical problem with learning taking place through a process of understanding and solving this problem [10,11]. Although the effect observed in terms of knowledge acquisition and changes in practice is only moderately greater for “problem-based learning” compared to traditional methods, this method has been most favoured by the majority of physicians and gives rise to greater motivation and satisfaction [12-17]. A review of the literature on the organization of CME activities based on case discussions and “problem-based learning” has helped to identify the few publications on the subject and the need to further document best practices in CME and the organizational issues involved in implementing this type of activity for general practitioners and psychiatrists [18]. The opportunity came up in Montreal with a CME initiative involving psychiatrists and general practitioners using case discussion to foster acquisition of mental health knowledge: the Intervisions cliniques program. More specifically, this article aims to: • Describe the Intervisions cliniques program as implemented in a university psychiatric hospital with a catchment-area responsibility for the east-end of Montreal (circa 500,000 inhabitants); • Identify the medical education vision and needs met by this approach; and • Explore the challenges involved in implementing the Intervisions cliniques program and the conditions that would be conducive to maintaining and generalizing the program.</td>\n",

They are commonly used in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent conditions. \"Add-back\" hormone replacement therapy is used to prevent menopause-like symptoms and bone loss during GnRHa treatment, but it is also recognized that hypoestrogenism adversely affects vascular function. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of GnRHa and add-back therapy on vascular reactivity. This model serves as a paradigm for the effect of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

One group received estrogen/progestogen add-back therapy during the second 3 months of GnRHa treatment. Vascular reactivity was examined by use of ultrasound measurements of changes in brachial artery diameter. Endothelium-dependent changes were assessed during reactive hyperemia, whereas endothelium-independent changes were measured after the administration of glyceryl trinitrate sublingual spray. Treatment with the GnRHa alone had an inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation. However, endothelium-dependent relaxation significantly improved in the group receiving add-back therapy (14.6%) compared with the group treated with GnRHa alone (8.6%) (P&lt;0.01).
